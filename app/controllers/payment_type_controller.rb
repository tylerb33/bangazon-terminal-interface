# The PaymentTypeController class will house everything related to payment types. Since this class has very limited uses, it could potentially just be rolled up into the Customer class. The main job of this class is to capture the new payment type / account number and get the info to the model where it will be sent to the DB. The main_menu_controller is required here because we reference it to bring the user back to the page that shows all available options.
