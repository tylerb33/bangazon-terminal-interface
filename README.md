### Prerequisites

``` Ruby ``` for installation guide, see [the official Ruby download page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

### Installing

In order to get this running on your system, just follow the below steps. Note that this program runs completely on the command line of your system.

- Clone down this repository, which will create a new directory for this project on your system
- Within the terminal, CD into this newly created directory
- Navigate to the ``` db ``` sub-directory
- Run the following command to initialize the database ``` ruby database.rb ```
    * The database now exists in the database_sprint2.sqlite file!
    * Note: there is also a test initialization file that will create a test database for you if you'd like to run that as    
    well, they both exist within this ``` db ``` directory.
- Within this project navigate into the ``` app ``` directory and, from the Terminal and input ``` ruby main.rb ``` to launch the program. Below are the options you will be presented with:

## Running the tests

All tests for this application can be found in the ```test_model``` and ```test_controller``` directories to test the models and controllers respectively. For an example, to run tests for one of the controllers you would just navigate to the test_controller directory and run one of the files. For instance, you could run ``` ruby customer_controller_test.rb ```. The test will be run with ``` Minitest ``` and results will display within the terminal.
